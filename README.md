Dataset can be downloaded from [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

If you run the model for the first time, please run 'train.py'

then you'll get a .h5 document which stores the model

At last, you can run the 'gui.py' to choose a picture for classification.

If you want to improve the accuracy, you can increase the epoch to more than 25.

The epoch now is 5
